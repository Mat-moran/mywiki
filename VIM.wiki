== Enviroment Usage ==

=== Windows ===

* `vsp`(vertical split), `sp`(split)
* `Ctrl` `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` (move throw windows)

=== Tabs ===

=== Search ===

* `?`                         (search in the document)
*  
* `<leader>k`                 (replace the cursor word)   

=== Fold ===

* `zf`                        (Fold operator --> motion follow)


In Vim the folds need to be pointed to be able to use the next commands. Is 
possible to save the fold status with `:mkview`

* `zo`                        (unfold)
* `zc`                        (fold)
* `zr` | `zR`                   (fold ...)
* `zm` | `zM`


== Text Editor Usage ==

Modes: Normal, Insert and Visual

The philosopy of Vim is to work with OPERATORS and MOTIONS in normal mode, the 
most powerfull idea behind Vim.

=== Operators ===

Operators let you operate in a range of text (define by motions)

* `d`     (delete)
* `y`     (yank)
* `c`     (change --> delete then insert)

* `>`     (indent rigth)
* `<`     (indent left)

=== Text Object ===

Objects in the normal mode to point to.

* p     (paragraph)
* w     (word)
* s     (sentence)
* [ ( { <         (a [],{},<> block)

=== Motions ===

* dd    (delete current line)
* dw    (delete to next word)
* db    (delete to beginning word)
* 2dd   (delete 2 lines) 
* dip   (delete a text object inside a paragraph)





== Tips ==

* in order to see icons in the proper way it is necessary to install Nerd Fonts in the system (and the vim Plugin). If not rare objects appear.
